    ! Async/Await

    ? Async/Await allows us to program using asynchronous requests, like a request to an API,
    ? "synchronous" manner - while still allowing other code to run in the background. This helps us keep our
    ? application or site responsive, reducing wait time for the user.

        - Allows us to program in a synchronous manner while still allowing code to run in the background.
        - Helps make our sites as responsive as possible.

/*
    ! Async Function (syntax)

    ? We can make a normal function into an asynchronous function. This also allows us to unlock the "await" capability/

        - allows us to make normal functions asynchronous & use await
        - must us the async keyword at the beginning of the function declaration.

}

const myAsyncFn = async () => {
    // await..
}

const newFn = () => {
    // await.. (provide a syntax error since the function is not declared as an async function)
}

// ? The await keyword is basically stating that once it hits this line of code, wait for it to finish executing and then move on.
// ? We are intoducing synchronous behavior to the application.

async function fn(){
    return "hello";

// ?Because we have used an async function. the reutn value "hello" is wrapped in a promise via the promise constructor.
// ?The body of an async function is always wrapped in a new promise. (resolve or reject)

//? Here is what a promise would look like being returned
/* alt representation of retuning a promise: */

function altFn(){
    return Promise.resolve("Hi")

//? async function ensures that the body of our function will return a promise

//! Await
/*
    ? Await allows us to pause an sync function's execution until a Promise is settled (fulfilled or rejected)

    - pause at each await expression
*/

//* A typical way to make request from API:
fetch("https://random.dog/woof.json")
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(json => console.log(json))
    .catch(error => console.log(error))

    //? This is an asynchronous fetch to an API (provides dog photos) As we know, it returns a promise (resolve or reject). The .then (our resolver)
    //? is used to grab the response an jsonify it and with the .catch (reject, we capture our errors. These are all being chained together.
    //? Each .then is returning a promise of it's own. This is considered method chaining)


    //?What about using await?
        // const response = await fetch("https://random.dog/woof.json");
        // const json = await response.json();
        // console.log(json)

            we wait for the request to finish. Once finished, it passes the resolved value to the response variable.

            line 2: We then jsonify the results we got back. This, again, waits until it is completed before moving on.

            Line 3: A console log displaying that json
